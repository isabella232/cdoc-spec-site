### Version

Version property indicates the version of the Collection.Doc specification that message represents. 

A Collection.Doc document SHOULD have a top-level version field. Currently, there's only one version of the specification: 1.0, the current version. As such, the version property, if present, MUST be set to 1.0, until there's another version of the specification. If the version field is ommited, it should be assumed to be 1.0.
