### Attributes

The `attributes` field is a JSON object that represents static state of the document. If you view a `Collection.doc+JSON` as encapsulating controls (links) and state, then `attributes` is where the state resides. The meaning of each attribute depends on the [profile](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6906.txt) of the document.

The attributes and their semantic meaning defined for the base media type are as follows:

#### guid 

Read-only, optional.May be present on output only. Not allowed during publish/save. Unique internal identifier of a document. A UUIDv4 schema SHOULD be used for generating guids. The only time an API client needs GUID directly is when creating a new document. Documents that are merely collections of search results will not necessarily have a GUID, as a search result collection is a dynamic resource identified by the URL of the search query itself. 

#### title

Read/write, optional. Title of the document.

#### hreflang 

Read/write, optional. ISO639-1 code of the language of the document. Defaults to 'en'.

#### valid 

Read/write, optional. The date-times that content is valid from and to. In ISO 8601 format. Allows scheduling of document publishing and expiration of content. API Clients MUST respect valid from/to fields. This field has following rules:
  - `valid.from` is optional and if omitted, `valid.from` = `created` date.
  - `valid.to` is optional and if omitted, `valid.to` = `valid.from` date + 1,000 years.

#### created 

Read-only, auto-generated. Date the content item was first saved, in ISO 8601 format. This field is system-generated and read-only to the API clients.

#### modified 

Read-only, date the content item was last modified, in ISO 8601 format. This field is system-generated and read-only to the API clients.
