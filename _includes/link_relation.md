### Primary Link Relation Types

Links are the most important part the hypermedia type, since they communicates the controls and relationships of the media item. Links is also where the biggest opportunity for standardization lies: most APIs implement the same controls in different ways. Standardizing those takes as huge way towards interoperable APIs and API clients.

For link relation types, used in Collection.doc, rather then inventing new ones, we really tried to use popular, standard IETF link relation types wherever possible. There are a handful of important link relation types that the media type defines and a client MUST implement.
