### Links

Top-level Links field is possibly the most important component of the `Collection.doc+JSON` media type. It contains hyperlinks representing various relationships that current document has to other documents and actions that can be performed in the context of the current document.

Links is also where the biggest opportunity for standardization lies: most APIs implement the same controls in different ways. Standardizing those takes us long way towards interoperable APIs and API clients.

In the JSON representation of the media type, the `links` field is a JSON object. Each top-level key of the JSON object is a [Link Relation Type (RFC5988)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-4) and the value is an array of Collection Document `Link Objects`. We call the link relationship types used for the top-level keys `Primary Relationship Type` of the corresponding links, to distinguish them from the `Secondary Relationship Type` that is explained below.

In Collection.doc+JSON a `Link Object` is a JSON object that has following fields:

- One of `href` or `href-template` fields MUST be present. An href attribute, if present, MUST be a valid [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). An href-template attribute, if present, MUST be a valid [URI Template](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570).
- `rels` field is optional, but typical. It is a JSON array of secondary relationship types. Secondary relationship types further determine the semantic purpose of a link. Secondary relationship type SHOULD be either a standards-registered relationship type (e.g. in case of [Navigation links](#navigation)) or a custom relationship type. Custom relationship type SHOULD be a proper, unique Uniform Resource Name (URN: [RFC2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)). 

    Typically there are multiple links associated with a primary link relation type in a document. For instance, you MAY have multiple `query` links. Secondary relationships allow to tell the difference between various query links, e.g. a `query for users' and 'query for groups' etc.:
        
    ```json
    {"links" : 
       {"query" :  
            {
                "href-template": "...",
                "title": "Query for users",
                "rels": [ "urn:pmp:query:users"]
            },
            {
                "href-template": "...",
                "title": "Query for groups",
                "rels": [ "urn:pmp:query:groups"]
            }
        }
    } 
    ```

`Collection.doc+JSON` media type inherits semantic meaning of many [standard Link Relations](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-6.2.2) for the Primary Link Relation Types, including the ones defined by [IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml) and [Microformats](http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values#non_HTML_rel_values). 


### Accepted Primary Link Relation Types

For link relation types used in Collection.doc, the emphasis is on using popular, standard IETF and IANA link relation types, rather than inventing new ones. There are a handful of important link relation types that the media type defines and a client MUST implement. Clients are free to implement additional standard link relations as far as they follow the Must Ignore strategy, as defined in the [Architecture of the World Wide Web](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-webarch-20040816/).

#### Query

Read-only. optional. List of templated URIs <sup>[RFC](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570)</sup> that describe range of Uniform Resource Identifiers that can be constructed through variable expansion to run searches for additional documents related to the context document.


#### Edit

Read-only. optional. A URI pointing to a document that provides information required for updating the document in the current context.

#### Creator

Read-only. optional. A URI pointing to a document that describes user or an organization whose API Key originally created current document.

#### Distributor

Read/write. optional. A URI pointing to a document that describes users or organizations that are allowed to fully administer the document. This is a mechanism for the original publisher of the content to share responsibility with or delegate responsibility of content administration to other collaborators. Distributors, alongside the creator, are the only party that can administer read/write permissions of a document.
