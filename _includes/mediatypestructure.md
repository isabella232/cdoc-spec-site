### General Structure

Despite its flexible and extensible nature, Collection.Doc is a very simple media type: it has only three top-level elements: 

- attributes: store "state",
- links: expose controls and communicate relationships 
- errors: are intended to facilitate reliable debugging of client/server interactions.
