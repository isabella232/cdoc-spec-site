### Pedigree and Motivation

Collection.Doc+JSON, documented in the following specification, is a JSON representation of the media type. Other representations (+XML, +XHTML, +HTML) can be created, but are out of scope for this document.

Collection.Doc+JSON is heavily based on [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/format/) hypermedia type and  leverages existing standards, such as: [URI Template [RFC6570]](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570), [Home Document Specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-03) and [IANA-registered Link Relation Types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml), wherever possible.

In contrast to some interchange formats before it, `Collection.Doc` is not a domain-specific content exchange format. Rather, `Collection.Doc` was designed to be a generic hypermedia type that can host more specific standards through semantic extensions: [profiles](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6906). The primary motivation behind `Collection.Doc` is to standardize traits common to the vast majority of content APIs: aggregating content items into collections, supporting internationalization, paginating large sets, providing rights management, templated querying, facilities for content update etc.â€”features that, alas, currently every API unnecessarily implements in their own way. 

In addition to the standardization of common traits, we deemed it equally important to also define *standard* extension mechanisms for the domain and product-specific parts of what an API may require to implement.
