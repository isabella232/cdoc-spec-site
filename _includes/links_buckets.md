### Collection and Item Links

Creating lists or buckets of documents is one of the most important task in content management, so we provide both of the two possible ways of doing so: top-to-bottom, as well as bottom-to-top definition of lists.

Item link: is a way to define collections top-down. This is when a document points to other documents that it contains. It's a 'contains' relationship, suitable for use-cases such as: "blog contains blog posts" or "news story contains asset documents" scenarios.

Collection link: is a bottom-up approach. In this case child documents themselves are pointing to which parent document they're associated with. It's a 'belongs to' relationship, suitable for things like document indicating: "I belong to these certain topics".
