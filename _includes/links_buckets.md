#### Collection and Item Links

Creating lists content items is one of the most important tasks in content management. Collection.Doc provides both of the two possible ways of defining a list: top-down and bottom-up.

`Item` link: is a way to define lists top-down. This is when a document points to other documents that it contains. It's a 'contains' relationship, suitable for use-cases such as: "blog contains blog posts" or "news story contains asset documents" scenarios.

`Collection` link: is a bottom-up approach. In this case child documents themselves are pointing to which parent document they're associated with. It's a 'belongs to' relationship, suitable for things like document indicating: "I belong to these certain topics".
